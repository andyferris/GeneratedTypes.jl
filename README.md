# GeneratedTypes

`@Generated` â€” *Prepare for the end of types as we know them...*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andyferris/GeneratedTypes.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andyferris/GeneratedTypes.jl)

**NOTE:** This package is currently limited to be Julia 0.4 only (see JuliaLang/julia#16806).

Julia's dynamic-yet-static type system is a careful balance between execution
speed and programmer convenience. Data can either be strongly-typed, creating
code with *C*-like speed, or boxed and inferred at run-time, which makes many
algorithms easier to write (with opportunities to optimize the most critical
code later).

However, underlying this, Julia *types* themselves are rather static objects.
While this is an understandable requirement to make compilation feasible (or
even sensible), there is room for a little extra freedom. Julia functions are
not only recompiled for each type *name*, but also for each unique set of
parameters of the input types. Thus, the system allows to decouple the
definition of the fields to the type-name, and bring this to a more granular
definition where the fields names, number and type may be fully-dependent on
the parameters of a type.

This is where `@Generated` types come in. Much like, `@generated` functions,
`@Generated` types allow one to generated code to specify the type definition
depending on the input. In this case, the input is not the types of the arguments
to the constructor, but rather is the parameters of the type itself. As a simple
example, take:

```julia
@Generated type MyVec{N,T}
    exprs = [:($(Symbol(string("x_",i))) :: T) for i = 1:N]
    Expr(:block, exprs...)
end
```

This creates what is more-or-less a static vector of length `N` and type `T` with
field names `x_1`, `x_2`, etc:

```julia
julia> v = MyVec{3,Float64}(1,2,3)
MyVec{3,Float64}(1.0,2.0,3.0)

julia> fieldnames(v)
3-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :x_1
 :x_2
 :x_3

julia> v.x_2
2.0
```

These generated types are (designed to be) fully-fledged Julia types that will
support all the features of the language, inference and codegen that apply to
standard `immutable` and `type` definitions.

### Implementation

The quickest explanation is the steps the package takes to register your generated
type:

1) The @Generated macro takes the type definition and creates an abstract type
of the same name as given.
2) The macro also creates and registers an abstract type constructor, which
is a @generated function.
3) When the user calls this generated function, it will use `eval` to create a
concrete subtype without any remaining type parameters and having a mangled name
(inserting `#` and the type parameters to the end of the name). This occurs just
once, during the codegen phase (or if you call the constructor with different
input, it won't attempt to reconstruct the type).
4) It overloads `Base.show` on the type to hide what is happening, also during
the codegen phase.
5) The generated function's action is to call the (inner) constructor of the
concrete type.

This provides a mostly invisible experience to the user (see limitations, below).
Since multiple dispatch works fine with the abstract type, it should be easy
write functions for the new type without knowing the mangled name. Outer
constructors can also be written for the abstract type (e.g. useful for where
some of the type parameters are not explicitly defined).

### Limitations

(1) Hopefully somewhat obviously, the code generation function can only depend on
the parameters of the type, and not for instance the type of the input to its
constructor. If it is not pure (constant in time), you may experience errors,
crashes, or other undefined behavior. If you wish to define your type depending
on the input to a constructor, you need to explicitly define extra constructors
and parameters on your abstract type (that call the fully-parameterized version).

(2) Secondly, the default "splatting" constructor simply passes the arguments from the abstract
type to the concrete type. Unfortunately, in Julia v0.4.5, this results in a
significant splatting penalty, so a range of more specialized constructors are provided,
with the splatting constructor as backup. By default, each type gets specialized
constructors for between 0 and 8 input arguments. To override this, specify the number
as an integer or collection as the first argument to the `@Generated` macro, as in:
```julia
# We know there is one field - no point creating 8 useless constructors!
@Generated 1 type NamedType{Name, T}
    :(Name::T)
end

# Users may want reasonably long static vectors, so we need lots of constructors
@Generated 0:32 immutable StaticVec{N,T}
    exprs = [:($(Symbol(string("x_",i))) :: T) for i = 1:N]
    Expr(:block, exprs...)
end
```

(3) Finally, calling `eval` from a generated function appears to be forbidden in
Julia v0.5, making the package as it stands inoperable on the latest nightly
builds.

### Some simple examples

```julia
# Same syntax as standard Julia:
@Generated type SingletonType
end

@show SingletonType()

# The contained code is the function that returns the body for the type, much
# like a @generated function.
@Generated type MyType
    if 1 < 2
        return :(a::Int)
    else
        return nothing
    end
end

@show MyType(1)

# We can build expressions to have arbitrary numbers of fields. For example,
# this is more-or-less a static vector on the stack of length N:
@Generated immutable StaticVec{N, T}
    exprs = [:($(Symbol(string("x_",i))) :: T) for i = 1:N]
    Expr(:block, exprs...)
end

@show StaticVec{1, Int}(1)
@show StaticVec{3, Float64}(10,11,12)

# Can use subtyping and complicated branching:
abstract MyAbstract{T,N}
@Generated type Foo{T} <: MyAbstract{T,1}
    if isbits(T)
        quote
            x::Vector{T}
        end
    else
        quote
            x::T
        end
    end
end

@show Foo{Int}([1,2,3])
@show Foo{ASCIIString}("abc")

# Can also register inner constructors:
@Generated immutable Positive{T <: Number}
    return quote
        a::T
        function R(x)
            if x < 0
                error("input must be non-negative")
            else
                new(x)
            end
        end
    end
end
@show Positive{Int}(1)
Positive{Int}(-1)
```
